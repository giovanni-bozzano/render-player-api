# Render Player API

This is a porting to 1.15.2 of Render Player API (originally developed by Divisor and deprecated in 1.12.1). The mod has been rewritten to use mixins.


Render Player API is an API which provides access to the client classes "PlayerRenderer", "PlayerModel" and "BipedModel" while minimizing conflicts between mods.
